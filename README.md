# Pong AI Never Miss 🧠🏓

This is a minimalist Pong game where **two AI players battle forever and never miss**. No randomness, no skill gap—just perfect tracking and infinite rallies.

## 🕹️ How it works

- The ball bounces back and forth forever.
- Both paddles are controlled by a simple AI that perfectly tracks the ball’s Y position.
- Made with vanilla HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript.
